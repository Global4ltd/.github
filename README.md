## üìÇ .github Repository

The **`.github`** repository is a special repository within a GitHub organization. It is used to store default community health files and other organization-wide settings that can be applied to all repositories within the organization. This helps standardize certain aspects across projects. Here‚Äôs what it typically includes:

### üìù Default Files

1. **README.md**
   - A public-facing README that introduces the organization and provides general information. If the `.github` repository includes a `README.md`, it will be displayed on the main page of the organization.

2. **CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Guidelines for contributing to the repositories in the organization. This file helps contributors understand the process for submitting issues or pull requests.

3. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**
   - A code of conduct file sets the expectations for behavior within the community and outlines consequences for violations. It promotes a healthy and respectful environment for contributors.

4. **SECURITY.md**
   - A file that provides information on how to report security vulnerabilities for the organization‚Äôs projects.

5. **ISSUE_TEMPLATE/** and **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/**
   - These templates help standardize the process for creating issues and pull requests across the organization. By including these templates in `.github`, they become the default for all repositories that do not have their own specific templates.

6. **FUNDING.yml**
   - A file to specify funding links, such as GitHub Sponsors or other donation platforms. This can be used to provide financial support options for projects.

### üåê Organization-Wide Usage

The `.github` repository allows the organization to:
- Create consistent documentation and processes across multiple projects.
- Reduce the need to duplicate files in every repository.
- Improve the contributor experience by providing clear guidelines.
